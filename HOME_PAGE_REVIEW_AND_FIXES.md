# Home Page Review and Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Theme Toggle Not Working ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Theme toggle button at the top was not working properly
**Root Cause**: Theme store initialization was not happening early enough in the app lifecycle
**Solution**: Added theme store initialization to `main.jsx` before the app renders
**Files Modified**: `src/main.jsx`

### 2. Emotional Score and Stress Level Logic ✅ EXPLAINED
**Current Implementation**:
- **Emotional Score**: Calculated based on:
  - Activity completion scores (last 7 days)
  - Consistency bonus (streak multiplier, max 50 points)
  - Emotional state bonus (positive entries × 5 points)
  - Formula: `activityScore + consistencyBonus + emotionalBonus`

- **Stress Level**: AI-powered detection using:
  - `useStressDetection` hook with manual trigger
  - Analyzes daily entries for stress indicators
  - Classifies stress types: Acute, Chronic, Anticipatory, Reactive, Eustress
  - Severity levels: Minimal (1), Mild (2), Moderate (3), High (4), Severe (5)
  - Uses `StressClassifier` service for analysis

**Files**: `src/stores/dataStore.js`, `src/hooks/useStressDetection.js`

### 3. Day Streak vs Current Streak Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Home page showed "Day Streak" while Dashboard showed "Current Streak" with different values
**Root Cause**: Home page was using `checkInStreak` (daily check-ins) while Dashboard used `activityCompletionStreak` (completed activities)
**Solution**: 
- Added both streak types to Home page for clarity
- Activity Streak: Shows consecutive days with completed activities
- Check-in Streak: Shows consecutive days with daily check-ins
**Files Modified**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`

### 4. Recommended Activities Navigation ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Try Now" buttons were not properly navigating to activities
**Root Cause**: Activity name matching was too loose and navigation logic had edge cases
**Solution**: 
- Improved activity matching with exact match first, then partial match
- Fixed navigation to use `?start=${activityId}` parameter
- Activities page now properly handles the start parameter
**Files Modified**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`

### 5. Connect Calendar Functionality ✅ ENABLED
**Problem**: Calendar integration was disabled by default in privacy settings
**Solution**: 
- Modified `handleConnectCalendar` to automatically enable external integrations
- Updates privacy settings before navigating to integrations page
- Google Calendar integration component is fully implemented and ready
**Files Modified**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`

## Data Logic Explained

### Emotional Score Calculation
```javascript
// Base score from completed activities (last 7 days)
const activityScore = recentLogs.reduce((total, log) => {
  const activity = activities.find(a => a.activityId === log.activityId)
  return total + (activity?.score || 0)
}, 0)

// Consistency bonus (streak multiplier)
const consistencyBonus = Math.min(streak * 2, 50)

// Emotional state bonus
const emotionalBonus = positiveEntries.length * 5

const totalScore = activityScore + consistencyBonus + emotionalBonus
```

### Stress Detection Logic
```javascript
// Uses AI classification based on:
// - Daily entry emotional state
// - Notes content analysis
// - Recent entry patterns
// - Stress triggers identification

// Stress types classified as:
// - ACUTE: Short-term, specific situation
// - CHRONIC: Long-term, persistent
// - ANTICIPATORY: Future events
// - REACTIVE: Past events
// - EUSTRESS: Positive, motivating stress
```

### Streak Calculations
```javascript
// Activity Completion Streak
getActivityCompletionStreak() {
  // Counts consecutive days with completed activities
  // Goes backwards from today until a day without activities is found
}

// Check-in Streak  
getCheckInStreak() {
  // Counts consecutive days with daily check-ins
  // Goes backwards from today until a day without entries is found
}
```

## Recommended Activities Logic

### Stress-Based Recommendations
- **When stress detected**: Shows stress management activities
  - Progressive Muscle Relaxation (7 min)
  - Breathing Exercise (3 min)
- **When no stress**: Shows general wellness activities
  - Mindful Breathing (5 min)
  - Gratitude Journal (3 min)

### Activity Categories
Activities are categorized under 3 main labels:
1. **Social**: Social meetup, Family time, Work out, Nature walk
2. **Mindfulness**: Me time, Learning, Cooking, Mindful breathing, Progressive muscle relaxation
3. **Journaling**: Gratitude and cognitive reframing

## Files Modified

1. **`src/main.jsx`** - Added theme store initialization
2. **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`** - Fixed navigation, added check-in streak, enabled calendar integration
